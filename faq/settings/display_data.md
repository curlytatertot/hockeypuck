"NUMBERS"
"Show full number in grid" will include X decimal places. Note, this is not always a useful option, in that most decimal places past two are not significant. You can opt for how many decimal places will show for non-currency numbers in the options below this one.
"Use parentheses to indicate negative numbers" — unchecking this box will put a negative sign in front of negative numbers instead.

"FILTERING" — The default is to not show cash or expenses buckets in the filter. Check the appropriate boxes to customize your view of the filtering buckets.
